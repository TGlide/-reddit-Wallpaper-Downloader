# -reddit-Wallpaper-Downloader
This is a simple tool I've created for day to day use to fetch wallpapers from https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/.

-It fetches up to 20 wallpapers from the hot section, attempts to download them and puts in a folder with a time stamp. 
e.g. A wallpaper from 20/03/2017 would be in /folder where main.py is located/data/wallpapers/20.03.2017/

-After downloading them, it randomly sets one of the downloaded files as the desktop background (Windows Only)
